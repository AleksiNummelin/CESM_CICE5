Changes made:

This tag involves extensive changes to accomodate padding, the new
incremental remapping transport is now the default, some various
enhancements and bug fixes. Note that the model exactly restarts
when padding is not active, but does not when padding is active.
This is a work in progress, but numerous users wanted additional
functionality that is now available. This tag is not bfb with the
previous tag, mainly due to the remapping transport. This did pass
exact restart tests for B and D cases at the gx1v5 and gx3v5 
resolutions.

Note that ice_transport_remap.F90 still has threading problems (that
seem to be resolution dependent). So for now most of the threading in
that module has been turned off.

Testing: 
1) no threading: 
	
when threading is not turned in in cice (via setting
setenv NTHRDS_ICE 1 in env_pes.blueice) then the results are bfb.
ERB.f19_g15.B.blueice was shown to be bfb with ccsm4_0_alpha28.	

2) threading versus no threading: 
when threading is turned on, results (via setting 
setenv NTHRDS_ICE 4 in env_pes.blueice) then threading tests showed
that the following two settings in the blueice run script
	setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 1 setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 4
gave bfb results in the cpl log files (as long as the bfbflag was set
to TRUE in env_run).	
In addition, examination of daily cice history files were shown to be
bfb when the above thread count was varied (for T62_g35.D.blueice case)
	
3) threading and restart:
the ERS.f45_g35.B.bluevista test passed when the following
pes_files was used for the test
      set ntasks_atm = 8; set nthrds_atm = 4; set rootpe_atm = 0; set pstrid_atm = 1
      set ntasks_lnd = 8; set nthrds_lnd = 4; set rootpe_lnd = 0; set pstrid_lnd = 1
      set ntasks_ice = 4; set nthrds_ice = 4; set rootpe_ice = 0; set pstrid_ice = 1
      set ntasks_ocn = 8; set nthrds_ocn = 1; set rootpe_ocn = 0; set pstrid_ocn = 1
      set ntasks_cpl = 8; set nthrds_cpl = 1; set rootpe_cpl = 0; set pstrid_cpl = 1

diagnostics. Also a change in the way that prescribed ice is done
to make it more compatible with standalone CAM.

CCSM Version compatible with:
Changes made:

The changes in ice_gather_scatter.F90 were to fix a segmentation
fault when land blocks are eliminated. Also, spval was used for
land blocks in stead of zero for the _real interface. This makes
the history output nicer. Some timers were rearranged in ice_step_mod
so hopefully the timings are more consistent. Also, ntrcr (number
of tracers) was reset to 1 by default.

This tag adds a new tracer, ice age, and slightly modifies the syntax
for the meltponds as a tracer. This version also includes a fix for
exact restart of the stresses in ice_dyn_evp on the dipole grid. The
tripole is still a work in progress. I've also added the serial (single-
processor) version of the communication modules. These changes should
be bfb with cice4_0_20071217.

       filename which can be used to start up the run.

       runs (i.e. runtype = 'continue")

A number of changes were introduced to merge with the head of the LANL
trunk. These were primarily some new transport changes. I've also removed
the hard coded print and write statements that use unit 6. This is the
first step towards using the shared unit manager utilities.

Version: 4.0
One-line Summary: Sequential CCSM changes
CCSM Version compatible with: 
Changes made:

Put in changes for running cice4 through sequential ccsm. Tested this
with only lat/lon grid capabilties.

The following files were modified
M      source/ice_init.F90
M      source/ice_state.F90
M      source/ice_restart.F90
M      source/ice_grid.F90

M      drivers/ccsm_sequential/ice_prescribed_mod.F90
M      drivers/ccsm_concurrent/ice_prescribed_mod.F90

The following files were added
A      drivers/ccsm_sequential/ice_communicate.F90
A      drivers/ccsm_sequential/CICE_InitMod.F90
A      drivers/ccsm_sequential/CICE_RunMod.F90
A      drivers/ccsm_sequential/CICE_FinalMod.F90

Summary of changes:
- ice grid, area and land mask are now obtained in latlongrid from a
netcdf kmt file (single column capability has not yet been upgraded)
- ice_grid.F90 now returns after the call to latlongrid or columngrid
since arrays since the following all arrays needed are now set in
  latlongrid (many to 1.e36)
- at this point, the columngrid capability will not work - this will be
fixed in an upcoming tag
- logic has been incorporated into ice_init.F90 to not have runtype or
runid in the ice namelist since in SEQ_MCT mode, the
  runid and runtype flags are obtained from the sequential driver and
not form the cice namelist
- bug fix for allocation on non-master processors was fixed in both
sequential and concurrent ice_prescribed.F90
- ice_communicate.F90 had to be added to ccsm_sequential in order to
provide capability of running in serial mode (SPMD if-def is introduced
  temporarily until mpi-serial can add features to support
MPI_GROUP_CREATE and MPI_COMM_CREATE).

CCSM Version compatable with:ccsm3_0_1_beta03 
Changes made:

This tag is for a CCSM beta release.  It has not been thoroughly tested or
undergone full scientific validation on the Cray.

ice_flux_in.F - Bug fix: changed int_kind to real_kind for real variable daymid.

All occurrences of the Cray directive  cdir$ ivdep  were replaced
with !DIR$ CONCURRENT, giving the compiler the best chance of generating
optimal code.

ice_transport_remap.F - Loops were switched in the initialization routine to
make code vector-friendly.  Loop switch is answer-changing because of roundoff
differences.  These differences did not appear in the standard exact restart
test.  10 day run was bfb with previous tag.

CCSM Version compatable with: ccsm3_0_beta17
Changes made:

User's Guide and Code Reference updated for CSIM5 and CCSM3.0 release.

Uncoupled CSIM scripts modified for default case in documentation.

ice.F             - Updated copyright date.

ice_diagnostics.F - removed unnecessary 'use ice_coupling'

ice_history.F     - bug fix in writing thickness category limits to
                    history file, corrected comment after frz_onset

ice_exit.F, ice_init.F -  Replaced nu_diag with 6, since nu_diag may be
                          used before the various processors know what it is.

ice_itd.F         - bug fixed in column_conservation check, now taking abs value
                    of the difference, not each quantity

ice_itd_linear.F - Made changes suggested by Cliff to avoid nonzero floating
                   point problem.  Removed vetamax and vetamin working arrays
                   and went back to original etamax/etamin scalars.

ice_transport_remap.F - Simplified init_remap to reduce difficulties for
                        compiler.  Answers change slightly due to different
                        order of operations in computing geometric quantities.

CHANGES TO CODE, INPUT/OUTPUT FILES, OR DOCUMENTATION:
------------------------------------------------------

Modules modified:

 ice.F          : A loop was added around the calls to evp, transport
                  schemes, and mechanical redistribution to reduce the
                  dynamics timestep.
 ice_calendar.F : ndyn_dt and dyn_dt declared
                  dyn_dt = dt/ndyn_dt is the timestep for the dynamics.
                  ndyn_dt is the number of iterations for the loop
 ice_dyn_evp.F  : dt changed to dyn_dt
 ice_init.F     :  ndyn_dt added to namelist
 ice_mechred.F  : dt changed to dyn_dt
 ice_transport_mpdata.F : dt changed to dyn_dt
 ice_transport_remap.F  : dt changed to dyn_dt

Did the restart files change? NO

Did any input data files change? NO

Did the code modifications require changes in the setup script? YES
  ndyn_dt was added to the namelist

Does the documentation (User's Guide, Science Guide, Code Reference)
need to be updated due to these changes?
  Yes, but it has not been updated in the CVS repository.

TESTING:
--------

  Platforms tested: IBM
  Machine names   : Blackforest
  CCSM Configuration(s): M
  Grid            : gx1v3_T42
  Number of PES for ice model: 8

Tests performed:

  Description: Code is BFB with csim4_8_8 if ndyn_dt = 1
  Length of test: 10 day

  Description: Restarts exactly if ndyn_dt = 2, u, v look very similar to
               those in  test with ndyn=1
  Length of test: 10 day

  Description: A longer run is in progress with ndyn = 2 to look at affect of
               this on the climate. Case is Mb18.idyn_dt.  Will be
               compared to Mb18.20lyrs. At 6 months, monthly averaged
               fields are practically identical, but instantaneous fields
               (sig1, sig2) are different.  sig2 has a Min of -6.537 for
               ndyn_dt=1, Min of -18.389 for ndyn_dt=2.  Takes about an
               hour to run a month.
  Length of test: 5 years

PERFORMANCE:
-----------

For ndyn_dt=2, overall ice model time increases by a factor of 1.5.
The following timing calls increased by a factor of 2 (for 10 days):

Timer number  0  Total    =   828.01 sec |  Timer number  0  Total    =  1279.17 sec
Timer number  1  TimeLoop =   739.17 sec |  Timer number  1  TimeLoop =  1187.26 sec
Timer number  2  Dynamics =   182.87 sec |  Timer number  2  Dynamics =   365.67 sec
Timer number  3  Advectn  =   234.22 sec |  Timer number  3  Advectn  =   466.55 sec
Timer number  6  Ridging  =     4.23 sec |  Timer number  6  Ridging  =     8.35 sec
Timer number  9  ReadWrit =    33.74 sec |  Timer number  9  ReadWrit =    65.63 sec
Timer number 10  Bound    =   110.64 sec |  Timer number 10  Bound    =   214.40 sec
Timer number 14  Snd->Rcv =   485.46 sec |  Timer number 14  Snd->Rcv =   939.10 sec


SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION:
----------------------

5 year test is in progress, see above. Output be at:

/SCHRAMM/csm/Mb18.idyn_dt

This will be compared to

/SCHRAMM/csm/Mb18.20lyrs

           calculations of totmn and totms), code works if ice reference
           salinity is zero

M config (non-zero ice salinity) - exact restart, salt is conserved
           in ice model, runs with DEBUG=TRUE

B config (non-zero ice salinity) - exact restart, salt is
           conserved in ice and ocean models, salt is conserved
           from ice(hourly)->cpl->ocn(once per day).

Added salt flux calculations so the ice reference salinity could
be changed from 0 to a non-zero value in the share constants and
the ice model can send a non-zero salt flux to the ocean.

ice_diagnostics.F - added hemispheric salt mass and flux budget information
ice_flux.F        - added variable for salt flux to ocean
ice_history.F     - writes out salt flux to history file, reads in and
                    writes out salt flux to restart file, salt flux
                    set to zero if it is not in the restart file
ice_mechred.F     - bug fix to make the snow transfer process preserve
                    the ratio of snow depth and ice thickness during
                    mechanical redistribution
ice_read_write.F  - added optional variables to ice_read subroutine
                    to read in salt flux if it is in the restart file,
                    allows backward compatibility with restart files.
ice_scaling.F     - divide salt flux by ice area before sending it to
                    coupler
ice_therm_driver.F - add ice melt water to the salt flux for lateral
                     melt, added diagnostic and history info
ice_vthermo.F      - add brine rejection/ice melt/snow flooding to
                     the salt flux for each category, add salt flux
                     to call to subroutine merge_fluxes

Model: CSIM
Version: CSIM4.8.1
One-line Summary: Bug fixes in ice_ocean.F; added open water advection to incremental reampping. 
CCSM Version compatible with: ccsm2_1_beta13
Changes made: 

ice_atmo.F, ice_ocean.F, ice_vthermo.F:

Fixed Lsub/Lvap bug, now pass in surface type to subroutine
stability, so Lsub is used for ice and Lvap is used for water.

ice_ocean.F:

Included Fswthru in calculation of SST.

ice_transport_remap.F:

Added advection of open water to incremental remapping.

ice_itd_linear.F:
   Added new logical variable (l_shift) to help this subroutine
   abort gracefully.  In rare cases where remapping fails, skip
   the shift_ice subroutine and allow rebin to move ice
   between categories if necessary.

One-line Summary: Modified output to history files, modified kdyn=0 case, added code reference and scientific document.
CCSM Version compatable with:ccsm2_0_beta41 
Changes made:

B config bfb with beta40
F config bfb with beta41

ice.F - modified so that kdyn=0 case works.  Added an if (kdyn=1)....endif
        around call evp, call transport, and call mech_red.  This gives
        answers to within roundoff compared to setting u and v to 0 after
        the restart file is read in in ice_history.F.   Modified user's
        guide to include this case.

ice_history.F - modified to include 9 new fields that have been multiplied
                by ice area to represent what affects the ice, not what is
                exchanged with the coupler.

ice.setup.csh - modified to eliminate fields in the history file where the
                entire field is not known by the ice model.  To increase
                model performance, only information on the part of the grid
                with ice is sent/recv to/from coupler.  Entire field was
                written to history file, even where information is not known.
                These fields have been removed from the history file via the
                namelist options.

Code Reference Guide added.

One-line Summary: Improved performance for OML model and prescribed ice model,
other minor fixes for consistency with User's Guide.
CCSM Version compatable with: ccsm2_0_beta40
 
Changes made:

o This tag is bit for bit with ccsm2_0_beta40 for the B configuration
o B configuration exactly restarts on gx1v3 grid.
o F configuration exactly restarts on gx3 grid.

o User's Guide update with recent revisions.

o Added ice_model_size.F.100x110.1 and ice_model_size.F.320x384.1 for
  running slab (single thickness category) ice model.

o Changed ntilay in ice_model_size.F.320x384x10 and ice_model_size.F.320x384x3
  to correct values.

o ice.setup.csh removed hist_to_mss and rst_to_mss

ice.F:
o Had to pass oceanmixed_ice into init_grid and popgrid.  This
  was to avoid a bug caused when adding 'use ice_ocean' directly
  into subroutine popgrid.  This is not an elegant way around this
  problem and will have to be re-examined in the future.

ice_coupling.F:
o pmask and rmask added to reduce amount of information being passed
  to the coupler for prescribed ice and OML runs.  Buffer being sent
  to the coupler is now packed.  Previously, values of eps12 for ice
  area were being sent to trick the coupler into sending data on the
  entire grid.

ice_grid.F:
o Mods to mask data so that data north of -40 lat and south of 35 lat is
  not sent to coupler for OML runs.  NOTE:  This will cause  problems
  when simulating a snowball earth.  This problem needs to be revisited.
  Model should stop if ice cover exceeds a certain area.

ice_history.F:
o Removed hist_to_mss and rst_to_mss.  $MSSDIR set in the main setup
  script will control when data is written to MSS. Tested 04/04/02.

ice_init.F
o Removed hist_to_mss and rst_to_mss.  Default of diagfreq changed from 0
  to 24.

ice_ocean.F
o Added Marika's bug fixes.  Fhnet should be multiplied by aice when calculating
  sst.

ice_prescribed.F
o Mods to read in a third date to determine where ice will be.  Info in grid
  cells where ice will be in next timestep will be exchanged with coupler.
  This is used to pack the buffer and speed up the prescribed ice model.

CCSM Version compatable with: ccsm2_0_beta40 
Changes made:

o This tag is bit for bit with ccsm2_0_beta40
o Exact restart test passed for D config, on gx3 grid

The following changes were made:

A /docs directory was added that includes subdirectories for
scientific documentation, reference guide, and user's guide.
The latex code for the user's guide has been included with
this version.

ice.F:
o shr_msg_mod was split into 2 subroutines to allow for all tasks
  changing to cwd, but only master task redirecting to stdio

ice_coupling.F:
o There was a bug in the cpl/ice diagnostics.  The numbers being
  reported by the ice model and the coupler didn't agree.  It
  looks like this problem resulted from the packing of the buffer.
  Changes were made to ice_coupling.F and msg_ice_mod.F90 to
  get the exchanged values to agree.

ice_history.F:
o Fixed typo in comment under netCDF variable Fresh

ice_ocean.F
o Fixed bug in ocean mixed layer calculation, cp_ocn should be
  cp_ocn*rhow

ice_tstm.F:
o Removed allocate and deallocate of arrays.  This speeds up the
  ice thermodynamics by a factor of 2.  These arrays are now declared
  using nmax, the maximum number of layers allowable in an ice thickness
  category.  This mod was tested alone and produces bit for bit results
  with beta 40 in the D (30 day run) and B (5 day run) configurations.

use the dates from the coupler and on the file. If dates need to be 
changed do so directly on the datasets.

Version: CSIM4.4.0
One-line summary: Cleaned up mixed layer model, added C. Bitz's bug fixes and new SW physics.

Changes made:

This version of CSIM4 includes Elizabeth's cleaned up version of
the ocean mixed layer model.  Cecilia's bug fixes have been added
as well as a wavelength dependent io.  A flag has been added to
receive a write history file command from the coupler, although
this feature hasn't yet been implemented.  A problem with no
restart file being written on the last time step has been resolved.
The script files have been updated to be similar to those used by
CCSM.  The build files are now those used by CCSM.  These last two
changes have resulted in several changes in the directory structure.
This version of the model has not undergone extensive testing.

Changes made:

This version of the ice model includes all of Elizabeth Hunke's bug
fixes, and Marika Holland's changes to the heat budget and exact restart
capability.  The model is capable of receiving a write_restart command
from the coupler.  Changes have been make to the share code by Tony
Craig.  Bruce Breigleb has included an ice thermo-only option and an
ocean mixed layer model.  The model has been run for 10 days on the gx1v2
grid.

Model: CSIM
Version: CSIM4.2.0
One-line summary: This version contains a new coupler interface and new dummy models.

Changes made:

These files have been modified to accommodate changes in the ice
model and the dummy models.  The ice model now passes calculated grid
cell areas to the coupler.  The coupler sends individual fluxes to the
dummy ocean model instead of a net flux.  Bruce's changes to the dummy
atm model (rain -> snow conversion and a SW factor) are now incorporated
into the new version of datm5.  This version of the active only ice model,
as checked out, will run with docn5 instead of the mixed layer model, since
in it's current state, the mixed layer model is not compatible with the new
dummy ocean.  Due to time constraints with CCSM and the novelty of the
cleaned up ice code, this version of the ice model has undergone minimal
testing.
