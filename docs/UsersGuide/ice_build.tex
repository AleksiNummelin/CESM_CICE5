\subsection{The Build Environment}

The build and configure environment has changed significantly from previous
versions of CCSM. See the CCSM documentation.

\subsubsection{CICE Preprocessor Flags}

Preprocessor flags are activated in the form {\tt -Doption} in the 
{\bf cice.buildexe.csh} script.  The flags specific to the ice model are

\begin{verbatim}
CPPDEFS :=  $(CPPDEFS) -DCCSMCOUPLED -Dcoupled -Dncdf -DNCAT=5 -DNXGLOB=$()
-DNYGLOB=$() -DNTR_AERO=3 -DBLCKX=$() -DBLCKY=$() -DMXBLCKS=$()
\end{verbatim}

The options {\tt -DCCSMCOUPLED} and  {\tt -Dcoupled} are set to activate the 
coupling interface.  This will include the source code in 
{\bf ice\_comp\_mct.F90}, for example.  In coupled runs, the CCSM coupler 
multiplies the fluxes by the ice area, so they are divided by the ice area 
in CICE to get the correct fluxes.

The options {\tt -DBLCKX=\$(NX)} and {\tt -DBLCKY=\$(NY)} set the number of
processors used in each grid direction.  These values are set automatically
in the scripts for the coupled model.  Note that {\tt NX} and {\tt NY} must 
divide evenly into the grid, and are used only for MPI grid decomposition.  
If {\tt NX} or {\tt NY} do not divide evenly into the grid, the model setup 
will exit from the setup script and print an error message to the 
{\bf ice.log*} (standard out) file.

The flag {\tt -DMXBLCKS} is essentially the threading option. This controls
the number of "blocks" per processor. This can describe the number of OpenMP
threads on an MPI task, or can simply be that a single MPI task handles
a number of blocks.

The flat {\tt -DNTR\_AERO=n} flag turns on the aerosol deposition physics in
the sea ice where {\tt n} is the number of tracer species and {\tt 0} turns
off the tracers. More details on this are in the section on tracers. 

The flag {\tt -D\_MPI} sets up the message passing interface.  This must be set
for runs using a parallel environment.  To get a better idea of what code
is included or excluded at compile time, grep for {\tt ifdef} and {\tt ifndef}
in the source code or look at the {\bf *.f90} files in the /{\bf obj} directory.
