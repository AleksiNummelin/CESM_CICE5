The setup scripts for the coupled model are 
located in {\bf ccsm4/scripts}. The directory structure of CICE4
within CCSM is shown below.

\subsection{Coupled Model Scripts}
\label{uncoupled_scripts}

The CCSM4 scripts have been significantly upgraded from CCSM3 and are
based on a completely different design philosophy.  The new scripts will
generate a set of "resolved scripts" for a specific configuration determined
by the user. The configuration includes components, resolution, run type, and
machine. The run and setup scripts that were previously in the {\bf /scripts}
directory for CCSM3 are now generated automatically.  See the CCSM4 User's Guide for
information on how to use the new scripts.  The file that contains the ice model
namelist is now located in {\bf ccsm3/scripts/\$CASE/Buildnml\_Prestage}. The
script containing the environment variables used for building the executable
file for the ice model is in {\bf ccsm3/scripts/\$CASE/Buildexe}.
The contents of the ice model namelist are described in section \ref{namelist}.
