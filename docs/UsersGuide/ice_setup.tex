The scripts for building the coupled and the uncoupled ice models are in
separate directories. The setup scripts for the coupled model are 
located in {\bf ccsm3/scripts}.  The setup scripts for the uncoupled model are
located in {\bf ccsm3/models/ice/csim4/src}.  The directory structure of CSIM5
within CCSM is shown below.

\subsection{Coupled Model Scripts}
\label{uncoupled_scripts}

The CCSM3 scripts have been significantly upgraded from CCSM2 and are
based on a completely different design philosophy.  The new scripts will
generate a set of "resolved scripts" for a specific configuration determined
by the user. The configuration includes components, resolution, run type, and
machine. The run and setup scripts that were previously in the {\bf /scripts}
directory for CCSM2 are now generated automatically.  See the CCSM3 User's Guide for
information on how to use the new scripts.  The file that contains the ice model
namelist is now located in {\bf ccsm3/scripts/\$CASE/Buildnml\_Prestage}. The
script containing the environment variables used for building the executable
file for the ice model is in {\bf ccsm3/scripts/\$CASE/Buildexe}.
The contents of the ice model namelist are described in section \ref{namelist}.
