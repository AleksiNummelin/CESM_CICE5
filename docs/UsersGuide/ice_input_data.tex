The coupled CICE model requires a minimum of three files to run:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf global\_\$\{ICE\_GRID\}.grid} is a binary file containing
        grid information and is renamed  \\
        {\bf data.domain.grid}  \\
        when it is copied to the executable directory.
  \item {\bf global\_\$\{ICE\_GRID\}.kmt} is a binary file containing
        land mask information and is renamed \\
        {\bf data.domain.kmt}.
  \item {\bf iced.0001-01-01.\$\{ICE\_GRID\}.20lay} or 
        {\bf iced.0001-01-01.gx3v5.040213} are binary files containing
         initial condition information for the gx1v3 and gx3v5 grids,
         respectively. The thickness distribution in this
         restart file contains 5 categories, each with 4 layers.
\end{itemize}

Depending on the grid selected in the scripts, the appropriate {\bf global*}
and {\bf iced*} files will be copied and renamed in the executable directory.
Currently, only gx3v5 and gx1v3 grids are supported for the ice and ocean
models.\\

An additional data file is necessary to use the ocean mixed layer within the
ice model, depending on the specified grid:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf pop\_frc\_gx1v3\_010815.nc} contains monthly averaged ocean forcing
        from POP output.
  \item {\bf pop\_frc\_gx3v5\_040212.nc} same as above, but for the gx3v5 grid.
\end{itemize}

This file is renamed {\bf oceanmixed\_ice.nc} when it is copied into the executable
directory.
