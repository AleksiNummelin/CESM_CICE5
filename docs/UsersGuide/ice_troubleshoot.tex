% Troubleshooting

\subsection{Code does not Compile or Run }

Check the {\bf ice.log.*} file in the executable directory, or
the standard output and error files for information.  Also,
try the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Delete the executable directory and rebuild the model.
  \item Make sure that there is a {\bf Macros.$<$OS$>$} file for your
        platform.  Modify the directory paths for the libraries.
  \item Make sure all paths and file names are set correctly in the scripts.
  \item If changes were made to the {\bf ice\_model\_size.F} file in the
        source code directory, they will be overwritten by the file
        in {\bf input\_templates}.  
         
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Negative Ice Area in Horizontal Remapping}

This error is written from {\bf ice\_transport\_remap.F} when the ice model
is checking for negative ice areas. If it happens well into a model integration,
it can be indicative of a CFL violation.  The output looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
  60: New area < 0, istep = 119588
  60: (my_task,i,j,n) = 4 21 380 1
  60: Old area = 0.960675000975677174E-05
  60: New area = -0.161808948357841311E-06
  60: Net flux = -0.976855895811461324E-05
  60:(shr_sys_abort) ERROR: remap transport: negative area
  60:(shr_sys_abort) WARNING: calling shr_mpi_abort() and stopping
  60:(shr_mpi_abort):remap transport: negative area 0
\end{verbatim}

The dynamics timestep should be reduced to integrate past this problem.  Set

\begin{verbatim}
 , ndyn_dt       = 2
\end{verbatim}

in the namelist and restart the model.  When the job completes set the value
back to 1.

\subsection{Conservation Error}

This error is written from {\bf ice\_itd.F} when the ice model is checking
that initial and final values of a conserved field are equal to within
a small value. The output looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
  Conservation error: vice, add_new_ice
  11  :  14  185
  Initial value =  1362442.600400560
  Final value =  1362442.600400561
  Difference =  2.328306436538696D-10
  (shr_sys_abort) ERROR: ice: Conservation error
  (shr_sys_abort) WARNING: calling shr_mpi_abort() and stopping
  (shr_mpi_abort):ice: Conservation error  0
\end{verbatim}

Non-conservation can ocur if the ice model is receiving
very bad forcing, and is not able to deal with it.  This has occurred
after a CFL violation in the ocean.  The timestep in the ocean may
be decreased to get around the problem.

\subsection{MPDATA transport unstable}

The ice model dynamics is subcycled {\tt ndte} times per timestep
so that the elastic waves are damped before the next timestep. 
When the value of {\tt ndte} is too small, an instability occurs,
the model execution stops, and an error message similar to this
example is written out to the log file:

\begin{verbatim}
mpdata phi =  -0.122707896960329384E-05  n =  5
(shr_sys_abort) ERROR: (mpdata) transport unstable
(shr_sys_abort) WARNING: calling mpi_abort() and stopping
\end{verbatim}

To get around this problem, increase the value of {\tt ndte} in 
the namelist.  Reasonable values of this parameter
are discussed in section \ref{nml_time_mgmt}.  The model
run can be restarted from the last set of restart files
that were written before the execution halted.

\subsection{NX does not divide evenly into grid}

If you modify the number of tasks used by the ice model, the model may stop
with this error written to the log file:
\begin{verbatim}
'ERROR: NX must divide evenly into grid,100,8'
\end{verbatim}

The number of MPI processors used by the ice model must divide evenly into the grid
dimensions.  For example, running the ice model with 8 tasks on the gx3v5
grid will result in an error, since 8 does not divide evenly into the
100 longitude points.  To fix this error, change the value of {\tt \$NTASKS} for the
uncoupled ice model in the main script.  In this case, a value of 4 would work, and
the task geometry would also have to be changed.

\subsection{Enabling the Debugger}

This section explains how to set some compiler options for debugging. For
the coupled model, set {\tt DEBUG} to {\tt TRUE} in the {\bf env\_run} script.
For the uncoupled ice model, set {\tt setenv DEBUG TRUE} in
{\bf csim.setup.csh}.  Before running the model, be sure to delete the
object files so that the source code will be recompiled.  If a core file
is created, it will be in the executable directory.  Use dbx to look at
the core file. Useful information may also appear in the standard error
and output files.

\subsection{Unit 50 Error}

Unit 50 is the restart file.  If the path or file name in the {\bf rpointer.ice}
file is incorrect, or the restart file does not exist in the {\bf /rest} directory
below the executable directory, the model will stop with this message:

\begin{verbatim}
8:1525-014 The I/O operation on unit 50 cannot be completed because an errno value
           of 2 (A file or directory in the path name does not exist.) was received
           while opening the file.  The program will stop.
\end{verbatim}

Verify that the path and file name in the rpointer are correct and that the restart
file exists in the correct location.
